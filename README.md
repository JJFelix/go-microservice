## A Simple go microservice
- In this project, we have a very simple go microservice, where
the jwt-creator generateds a jwt token when you hit its endpoint, and that generated token can be consumed(parsed) by the api running on another endpoint.
- This project is just a simple concept that can be expanded into a bigger microservice architecture
